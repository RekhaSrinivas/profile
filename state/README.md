# US State Reports<!-- ScoreCards -->

View state reports via the links to the left.  
We have a [new chord and sankey display](../footprint/sector_supply_impacts.html) and an updated [impact bubble chart](../../io/charts/bubble/#state=AL).   
A new CO2e column has been added to the [commodities report](../footprint/commodities.html).

## US State Data

[View Feb 2024 State Models Report](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=360453&Lab=CESER) regarding new data files for v1.0 of the USEEIO State Models. 

The report includes [Excel versions of 2020 models](http://doi.org/10.23719/1530076) for all states.
 
The 2020 state data resides in [ModelEarth/useeio-json on GitHub](https://github.com/ModelEarth/useeio-json/tree/main/models). Generated by running [dumpjson](../) 

TO DO: Create interactive version of the supporting figures [including maps of the U.S.](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7041473) showing environmental pressure intensity grouped by indicator and commodity for all states and rankings of sectors by consumption by environmental pressure for 2020.

### State Models Report

[ERG Adds New Data to National GHG Emissions Accounting Data Set](https://www.erg.com/news/erg-adds-new-data-national-ghg-emissions-accounting-data-set)

[The 2024 State Models Report map JPEG images](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7041473) document the following factors for indicating environmental pressure intensity.

All the maps of per dollar produced in a year by a state are derived using the N matrix values from the respective state model for the state commodity and state location and (e.g. 23/US-GA).  Other figures might be derived from calculations with model matrices.

**The N matrix** containing **direct and indirect impact coefficients** for different commodities for duplicating the report. These coefficients capture environmental pressure activities like emission and resource use associated with both direct and indirect activities. N matrix gives us the direct and indirect impact coeff for all 411 sectors, whose API we can use to rank environmental pressure intensity per state. As N matrix uses equivalency/$ as its value unit, it will be useful for calculation of total environmental impact attributed to each sector. 

**Make Matrix (V)** -  contains the total production or output of commodities by industry (sector) in each state (useful for associating production activities with environmental pressures).  

**Use Matrix (U)** -  shows how much of each commodity is consumed by different sectors. Useful as it links consumption patterns to environmental indicators.  

**The U\_d (domestic use) matrix** is a subset of the Use matrix (U). It outlines domestic consumption patterns which could be key for calculating within-state environmental pressures from production/consumption.  

**L (total requirements matrix)** to model direct and indirect environmental impacts.  

**"flows" matrix**, to link economic activities to environmental pressures.  

**"final\_demand\_meta" matrix** to indicate consumption-based environmental pressure.  

**A (Direct Requirements)** for calculating direct environmental pressure intensities.  

The US EPA provides [USEEIO-State R code](https://github.com/usepa/USEEIO-State) related to these figures to help make the calculation procedures consistent.

## Build for new State Models

On Sept 15, 2024 - Laksh and Anubhav fixed the [tslib error](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio.js/issues/2) in the npm build which resulted in a new dist/useeio.js and dist/useeio.min.js files. We're not sure if the fix will now get the new state models working with the prior [React IO charts](../../io/charts/). If the useeio_widgets.js file remains unchanged after the tslib error fix, we'll need to figure out what needs to be done for the new 50 state model structure.


1. Fork the useeio-widgets repo (Have Loren sync with the parent USEPA repo.)
https://github.com/modelearth/useeio-widgets

2. Change line 37 in package.json to use modelearth rather than USEPA
https://github.com/ModelEarth/useeio-widgets/blob/master/package.json  
"useeio": "github:modelearth/useeio.js"

3. Before and after [building useeio-widgets](https://model.earth/io/charts/react/), point [iochart.html](http://localhost:8887/useeio-widgets/build/iochart.html#indicators=ENRG,GHG,VADD) at the new state models in useeio-json and add at line 27:

		// To test state data - Use GA, ME, MN, OR, WA for ones in API folder.
		modelID = "GAEEIOv1.0";
REACT WIDGET ISSUE: You will then see $0 in the center column.

5. Make a local copy of "useeio-widgets/build/lib/useeio\_widgets.js" in the "io" repo and replace "io/build/useeio\_widgets.js". You can see what changes using the diff in Github Desktop.  

6. Now [run the useeio_widgets build steps](https://model.earth/io/charts/react/).
<br>BUILD ISSUE:  
The size of useeio-widgets.js increases from 3.12 MB and 3.3 MB to 13.6 MB


7. If the output is small again, we'll place the resulting [useeio_widgets.js file in io/build/lib](https://github.com/ModelEarth/io/tree/main/build/lib)  

Here's a page to test with locally to see if values appear in the middle column. This page already points at the new state models and the middle column values are 0 as a result:
[http://localhost:8887/io/build/iochart.html#indicators=ENRG,GHG,VADD](http://localhost:8887/io/build/iochart.html#indicators=ENRG,GHG,VADD)
[https://model.earth/io/build/iochart.html#indicators=ENRG,GHG,VADD](https://model.earth/io/build/iochart.html#indicators=ENRG,GHG,VADD)
